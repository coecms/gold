#undef  CARTESIAN

                               !  is defined, otherwise use a latitude-longitude

#define XMETRIC_J

#define YMETRIC_J
#define YMETRIC_I
                               !    Define XMETRIC_J if the x-direction metrics
                               !  vary in the y- (or j^) direction.  Otherwise
                               !  undefine XMETRIC_J.  XMETRIC_I, YMETRIC_J,
                               !  and YMETRIC_I are used similarly.
                               !  CARTESIAN overrides all of these choices.
                               !    For example, on a regular latitude/longitude
                               !  grid, define XMETRIC_J and undefine the rest.
                               !  For a Mercator grid, define only XMETRIC_J and
                               !  YMETRIC_J.  Defining all of these always
                               !  works, but the model will be slower.

!  Specify the numerical domain.
#define NXTOT NONSENSE_NXTOT
#define NYTOT NONSENSE_NYTOT
                               !    NXTOT and NYTOT are the number of thickness

#undef STATIC_MEMORY
                               !    If STATIC_MEMORY is defined, the principle
                               !  variables will have sizes that are statically
                               !  determined at compile time.  Otherwise the
                               !  sizes are not determined until run time. The
                               !  STATIC option is substantially faster, but
                               !  does not allow the PE count to be changed at
                               !  run time.
#undef  SYMMETRIC_MEMORY
                               !    If defined, the velocity point data domain
                               !  includes every face of the thickness points.
                               !  In other words, some arrays are larger than
                               !  others, depending on where they are on the 
                               !  staggered grid.

#define NXPROC NONSENSE_NXPROC
                               !    NXPROC is the number of processors in the

#define NYPROC NONSENSE_NYPROC
                               !    NYPROC is the number of processors in the

                               !  arrays, so it should be set generously.

#define NX_HALO 2
